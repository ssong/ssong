## Options for donating to Ukraine directly

Below are a couple of ways of maximising the efficiency of your donation rather than donating through a bureaucratic organisation like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)

>[Come Back Alive](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua) - Organisation based purely on supplying the Ukrainian Army and volunteer forces with **defensive equiptment, technology, and training**. The emphasis is on saving lives and the organisation does NOT purchase lethal equiptment. They offer card payment options through Fondy.eu, crypto payments, and SWIFT payments.

>[National Bank of Ukraine - Armed Forces fund](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi) - The official account of the National Bank of Ukraine through which you can send funds directly to the UA government / Ukrainian Armed Forces without any intermediaries. They offer card, crypto, and SWIFT payment options. They also offer distinct EUR, GBP, USD, and JPY accounts and have IBAN's listed for all of them, but you can use standard domestic transfer options if you live in one of those countries.

>[National Bank of Ukraine - Humanitarian fund](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-rahunok-dlya-gumanitarnoyi-dopomogi-ukrayintsyam-postrajdalim-vid-rosiyskoyi-agresiyi) - The official account of the National Bank of Ukraine through which you can send funds directly to the Ukrainian Ministry of Social Policy without any intermediaries. The fund will be used to provide shelter, food, and clothes to those displaced by the war in Ukraine. They offer card, crypto, and SWIFT payment options. They also offer distinct EUR, GBP, USD, and JPY accounts and have IBAN's listed for all of them, but you can use standard domestic transfer options if you live in one of those countries.
