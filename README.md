>[Come Back Alive](https://www.comebackalive.in.ua) - Organisation based purely on supplying the Ukrainian Army and volunteer forces with **defensive equiptment, technology, and training**. The emphasis is on saving lives and the organisation does NOT purchase lethal equiptment. They offer card payment options through Fondy.eu, crypto payments, and SWIFT payments.
